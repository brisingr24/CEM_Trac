Construction Equipment Maintenance Tracking

System and Method for Maintenance Tracking of Contruction Equipment.
Ongoing Patent Project done under SRM faculty.
In India, a lot of times, construction projects sometimes get delayed due to untimely maintainence of construction equipment or parts of the construction vehicles, which thus increases the cost of construction. CEM_Trac aims at keeping a check on these parts and alert the maintainence team to change the required part. It will also have a section to add new projects, and then add the components being used in that project to help keep track of equipments in a better way.
